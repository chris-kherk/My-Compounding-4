                <p>
                    The process of having your medicine compounded without allergies “allergen-free compounding” begins with a consultation between you, your healthcare provider, and a compounding pharmacist. During this consultation, you will be asked a series of questions as your allergies and sensitivities are carefully assessed. Based on this information, the pharmacist formulates a treatment plan, which may include allergen-free medications, skincare products, or other preparations, a prescription may be required at which the your healthcare provider may provide and have the team at My Compounding Pharmacy prepare your medication.
                </p>

                <h4>Preservative-Free Products</h4>
                <p>
                    If you’re searching for preservative-free medications, look no further than your local compounding pharmacy. My Compounding Pharmacy could be the answer. Our store, has the expertise and equipment needed to create custom formulations that are entirely preservative-free.

                <h4>Medication Allergies</h4>
                <p>
                    The primary way My Compounding Pharmacy can assist patients with medication allergies is by customising medications to eliminate allergenic components. Our Pharmacists can reformulate a medication, removing unnecessary and potentially harmful inactive ingredients, and substituting them with safe alternatives. For example, if a patient is allergic to a dye used in a pill, our compounding pharmacist can create a dye-free version of the medication. Similarly, for those allergic to gluten or lactose, medications can be made without these substances. Moreover, we have the ability to alter the form of medication, making it easier for patients to take their prescriptions. For instance, a patient who has difficulty swallowing pills and is allergic to the fillers in liquid medication might benefit from a custom-compounded topical gel or cream that delivers the medication transdermally, bypassing the need for oral ingestion entirely.
